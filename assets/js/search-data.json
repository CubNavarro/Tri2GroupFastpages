You will need 1 laptop | You and Your Group will have the maximum of 5 minuets to complete this prompt | Open a File or a Place to code a procedure | In order to gain points you must get the procedure right and have all correct elements of a procedure | If you finish first and its correct 2pts | If you finish within the 5 miniuets and you are correct 1 pt | You can only get your answer checked 2 times if you get it wrong both times its checked you automatically fail the challenge for that prompt. | . Prompt #1 . Write A Procedure to get the character to the finish line | . Prompt 2 . Get the Person to the red block by writing a coding procedure | . # Prompt 3 . Write a Procedure that updates a the quiz score if you get a better score on the next quiz use these VARIABLES: INITAL SCORE = 25 RETAKE SCORE 56 OUR OF 60 Points | .",

Procedure-is a named group of programming instructions that serves a purpose | How to code Procedures-While Coding a procedure you must makes sure it has as name and a clear purpose weather to executre a response or complete an action | One common type of abstraction is procedrual abstraction, which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be only knowing what it doe,not how it does it. | The subdivision of a computer program into sepearate subprogrames is called modularity, | . How do we make our procedure purposeful and consice . to make a procedure serve a purpose it should be able to hae multiple functions | Also to keep a procedure maximizing capability it should be simple and reduced to get the final result | . What is important to do while writing procedures . It is important to understand you procudeures procedure does when creating one as it will help you create a impactful procedure | . Procedure That Update Grade Based on retake . after you take a quiz your teacher lets you retake it for full credit in which your are able to replace your grade | TEST WITH first quiz GRADE is 40% and second is 90% | PROCEDURE updateGRADE { points, current grade,new grade currentGrade = current points /75 | currentGrade = current crade * 100 if currentGrade &gt; quizGrade | return currentGrade } | . | . | .
