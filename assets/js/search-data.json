By applying Boolean logic operations to binary inputs, which can be used to conduct arithmetic, comparison, and control operations in a computer’s central processing unit (CPU) and other digital circuits, logic gates can be utilized to execute fundamental computer functions. . | While logic gates are actual physical devices or circuits that physically implement these operations by controlling the flow of electricity through them, Boolean operations are abstract mathematical operations that are defined in Boolean algebra. Logic gates are the physical components that carry out boolean operations in digital circuits, whereas boolean operations are abstract notions used to express logical relationships between variables. . | . Binary Logic . . Binary Math . Write the two numerals one above the other, with the subtrahend (the second number) appearing beneath the minuend (the first number). Subtract each digit from its corresponding digit in the minuend, beginning with the subtrahend’s rightmost digit. Borrow 1 from the digit that is next to the left in the minuend if the digit in the subtrahend is larger than the digit in the minuend. Below the corresponding digits of the subtraction, write the outcome of each subtraction. The borrowed digit in the minuend is lowered by 1 if any borrowing occurs in step 2 at all. Until there is no more borrowing, this process is repeated. Create a binary number from the result of the subtraction. . | | . . API hacks . . .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. .

The backend is naturally distributed as it typically consists of multiple servers, each responsible for handling different tasks or services. By distributing the backend, the application can handle a large number of requests, improve performance and reliability, and provide fault tolerance and high availability. The frontend, on the other hand, is typically executed on a single client device, such as a web browser or mobile app, and is responsible for displaying the user interface and interacting with the user. . | Analyze this command in Docker: ENV GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=&quot;--workers=1 --bind=0.0.0.0:8086&quot;. Determine if there is options are options in this command for parallel computing within the server that runs python/gunicorn. Here is an article . | . In the context of a Docker image that runs a Python/Gunicorn web application, this command is used to configure the Gunicorn web server. The –workers option specifies the number of worker processes that Gunicorn should spawn to handle incoming requests. In this case, the value is set to 1, which means that Gunicorn will use a single worker process to handle all requests. The –bind option specifies the IP address and port number that Gunicorn should bind to, in this case, 0.0.0.0:8086, which means that Gunicorn will listen on all network interfaces on port 8086. . To enable parallel computing in Python/Gunicorn web application, you can adjust the –workers option to a higher value, which will spawn multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests concurrently. However, increasing the number of worker processes may also increase the memory usage and CPU load of the server. .

A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a ___. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is ___. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary. As always, documentation is always the main source for all the full capablilties. . lover_album = { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Lover&quot;, &quot;artist&quot;: &quot;Taylor Swift&quot;, &quot;year&quot;: 2019, &quot;genre&quot;: [&quot;Pop&quot;, &quot;Synth-pop&quot;], &quot;tracks&quot;: { 1: &quot;I Forgot That You Existed&quot;, 2: &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, 3: &quot;Lover&quot;, 4: &quot;The Man&quot;, 5: &quot;The Archer&quot;, 6: &quot;I Think He Knows&quot;, 7: &quot;Miss Americana &amp; The Heartbreak Prince&quot;, 8: &quot;Paper Rings&quot;, 9: &quot;Cornelia Street&quot;, 10: &quot;Death By A Thousand Cuts&quot;, 11: &quot;London Boy&quot;, 12: &quot;Soon You&#39;ll Get Better (feat.

Uses PRAGMA statement to read schema. . Describe Schema, here is resource Resource- What is a database schema? A database Schema is a blue print or a plan tha make up a database. It helps make up the data elements and tables without the user. . What is the purpose of identity Column in SQL database? The purpose is to provide a identifier to each row of the table | What is the purpose of a primary key in SQL database?

A connection object is an object that represents a connection to the database and is used to allow the programmer to execute commands | Same for cursor object? A cursor object allows the programmer to fetch data row by row and perform different operations | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object?

It can be dangerous because you could delet all of your data and information and it can not be recovered. | What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? f is used to embed expressions inside of string literals.
